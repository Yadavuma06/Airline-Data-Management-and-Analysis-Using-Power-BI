# Airline-Data-Management-and-Analysis-Using-Power-BI

Beginner-friendly Power BI project that integrates flight, passenger, and ticket data, performs cleaning and modeling, applies DAX measures, and delivers an interactive dashboard with RLS and automated refresh.
This project demonstrates how Power BI can be used to manage, analyze, and visualize airline operational data for improved decision-making.

📌 Problem Statement

The airline industry generates massive data across flights, tickets, and passenger records. Efficiently managing this data is critical to improving operations and customer satisfaction.

📂 Datasets Used

Flight_Information.xlsx – FlightID, FlightNumber, Airline, Destination, Status

Passenger_Information.xlsx – PassengerID, FlightID, SeatNumber

Ticket_Information.xlsx – TicketID, FlightID, BookingStatus

⚙️ Implementation Steps

Data Preparation & Cleaning – Removed duplicates, fixed data types, trimmed columns.

Data Modeling – Established relationships between flights, passengers, and tickets.

DAX Measures – Created KPIs (total passengers, tickets, best flights, etc.).

Visualizations – Built interactive charts:

Passenger count by airline

Ticket booking status (donut chart)

Flights by airline & destination

KPI summary cards

Security & Automation – Added Row-Level Security (RLS) and scheduled refresh in Power BI Service.

📊 Key Insights

Airline A had the highest passenger count.

Phoenix emerged as the top destination.

Most flights classified as “Best.”

Confirmed tickets dominated booking status.

🔗 Dashboard Features: Filters by Airline, Destination, Performance Category, and Booking Status.

🔹 LinkedIn Post Description

✨ Excited to share my latest Power BI project: Airline Data Management and Analysis Dashboard!

In this project, I connected multiple datasets (flights, tickets, passengers) and transformed them into an interactive dashboard that provides real-time insights into airline operations.

📌 Key Highlights:
✔ Built an end-to-end data pipeline in Power BI (cleaning, modeling, DAX calculations).
✔ Designed interactive visuals for ticket status, passenger count by airline, and flight performance.
✔ Implemented Row-Level Security (RLS) and scheduled refresh for secure, up-to-date reporting.
✔ Derived actionable insights — Airline A has the highest passengers, Phoenix is the most traveled destination, and confirmed bookings dominate.

This project reinforced my data analytics and visualization skills using Power BI while showing how data-driven insights can help the airline industry optimize operations and improve customer satisfaction.
